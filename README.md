## Struggles

Version 2.0 issues 2021:
- Refactored with SCSS and the media queries imported incorrectly. 

Version 1.0 issues 2020:
- Forgot a basic thing such as css/styles.css to link the css stylsheet path. Forgot css/.

- Was struggling to make my columns adjust with media queries. Forgot about the calc function. Instead I was trying to give different projects, seperate classes and float. WRONG. Didn't work :) Thank you calc function.
